			<p><strong> Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</strong> is a survival horror game that has been rumored to make some people wet themselves. The game was developed by Capcom, and realeased in January 2017. This is the eleventh installment in the Resident Evil series. It is the <em>first</em> to be played from a first-person perspective and be compatible with the Playstation VR (Virtual Reality).</p>

		<footer> This <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/games/resident_evil_7_biohazard/b/playstation4/archive/2017/01/23/a-familiar-taste-of-blood.aspx">site</a> has a good amount of content on RE7, and I think it uses html to layout the content nicely. It also utilizes images and video to further show and explain the content to readers. I think the code is formatted nicely so it's easy to follow, but there is a lot within it that I do not understand. The creator also used a lot of elements and attributes to make their page 'pretty' and organized.</footer>
