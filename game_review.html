		<li><strong>Fun Factor</strong></li>
		<p>If you like scary, unpredicatable, and intense situations that keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time, then this game is for you. Resident Evil 7 packs scares and secrets around every turn.</p>

		<li><strong>Control & Gameplay</strong></li>
		<p>In Resident Evil 7, the play controls Ethan Winters, a man who's traveled to the Baker Farm in search of his wife, Mia, who went missing 2 years ago. The game is played from a first person perspective making it extra creepy and realistic (especially if playing it on the PS VR).</p>

		<p>Unlike previous resident evil titles, you have fewer skills but access to a variety of weapons that you find while traversing the Baker Family Farm.</p>

		<p>The game is actually more focused on horror than action. You are pretty much playing your way through a horror movie (who wouldn't love that?!</p>

		<li><strong>Graphics</strong></li>
		<p>AMAZING! There's really nothing else to say.</p>

		<li><strong>Sound</strong></li>
		<p>The sound is amazinga and fantastically creepy. Every creak or whisper will have you looking over your shoulder (especially in VR when you feel like someone is breathing on the back of your neck!).</p>
		
		<li><strong>Replayability</strong></li>
	</ol>
