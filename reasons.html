<h1>My Thoughts on Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</h1>
<p> Overall, I really enjoy this new installment of Resident Evil, it might actually be my all time favorite ... I'll get back to you on that. </p>
<p> The game offers a good amount of content, a great story and a good scare for those who enjoy horror. It keeps you interested, challenges you and doesn't fail to offer a few surprises here and there.</p>

        <td>Controls can get kinda clunky during boss fights making it difficult to maneuver</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Content</td>
        <td>Great story with twists and turns, puzzles to get you thinking, keeps you on your toes and there's hours of gameplay plus DLC to keep you intersted</td>
        <td>Would have liked a more robus move/ability set for the main character instead of just relying upon the weapons found</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      	<td>Weapon Choices</td>
      	<td>Good amount of weapon choices - machine guns, pistols, flamethrower, etc</td>
      	<td>Would have liked more melee weapons. If I pass a bat I should be able to pick it up, same goes for a hammer or crowbar.</td>
